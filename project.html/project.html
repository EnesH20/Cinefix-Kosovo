                                    <p>Zana released on September 9th 2019 to great reviews and international critical acclaim. The movie was shown on opening night at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) and surprised it's audience with its colorful palette, amazing acting and accurate depiction of PTSD. Zana won two awards that night becoming the first feature film from Kosovo to open the night and win two awards.</p>

There is just so much passion and love put to this project. It truly portrays sadness and even madness in a scarily accurate way". </p>

                                    <p>Tisa is a 20 minute long emotional rollercoaster. A movie about love, friendship and family that tells this beautiful story in only 20 minutes. One of the best short films to come out of Balkan, hell even Europe!
                                    There are obvious references to french cinema leading us to believe some kind of symbolism behind the whole movie...so we interviewed the director and he had this to say:</p>
                                    <p class="tm-text-yellow float-right mb-0">"I am personally a very big fan of french cinema. Movies like La Haine and Breathless are the reason I started directing. I reference them a lot in my work because similiar to those movie my work too tries to accept and show reality, as sad as the ladder may be."</p>

                                    <p>We saved the best for last here. Shok (that stands for "friend" in Albanian) is the biggest achievment in Kosovo's fine and almost half-a-century old cinematography. Shok tells the story of two young best friends just trying to survive, scared off their lives because of the tirany and genocide done by the Serbian army. Although the film is not a true story, the setting is - which makes the movie even more frightening and emotional. It broke the barrier being the first kosovar film to reach the prestigous Oscars where it unfortunately didn't win. </p>
                                    <p class="tm-text-orange float-right mb-0">Reviewers and critics around the world praised Shok for its astonishing cinematography and very good acting performances. Shok went on to gain a whopping 81% on Rotten Tomatoes and to this day is the highest rated movie to come out of the beautiful and gloomy Balkan!</p>

                    <p>We already told you in our info box what this website is about. What we didn't tell you is what objective we intend to reach with it. During the 2020 Oscars the world was shocked by the racist comments and reactions sorrounding the korean film "Parasite" after it won the highest award beating a list full of american-based films. Movies have always intended to make us united. One of the purest forms of art and communication. They were never meant to fuel hatered and anger. </p>

                    <p>Our website wants and hopes to reach that objective.All the movies in this list contain subtitles and are accesseible to everyone. All three of them are gloomy and sad but depict the Republic of Kosovo at its lowest point in history. Don't forget: "You can't build your future without embracing your past".</p>

                    <p>We chose Kosovo and the entirety of Balkan to showcase to anyone interested in witnessing these countries' progression over time. How these countries were able to get back on their feet with the power of unity and admiration. We hope you find out about new things and events and even places with us, as we hop on this crazy Balkan-themed ride and its tragic but inspiring history, possible only through the beautiful world of cinema :) </p>
